    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>to Veetok's Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to review it.We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always live up to your trust. So let's understand what information we collect, what we collect it for, how we use it and what choices you have regarding the use of your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in simple language, with a minimum use of legal and technical terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Where our Privacy Policy applies</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, applications, events and other services provided by Veetok. For convenience, we will refer to all of these as "services" in this Privacy Policy. To make this clearer to you, we have added links to this Privacy Policy on all relevant services.</p>
    <p>Some services may have their own privacy policies. If any service has its own policy, the policy of the service will apply and not this Privacy Policy.

    <h2>2. The information we collect</h2>
    <p>It goes without saying that we cannot help you get to know each other unless we have some information about you, such as basic profile information and characteristics of the people you want to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services, such as traffic logs and information from third parties, such as when you access our services through a social media account or when you upload social media information to your profile. We will explain more about this below.
    <b>The information you provide to us</b>
    <p>When you use our services, you provide us with certain information. This includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you create an account, at a minimum, you provide us with your phone number and email address, as well as some basic information needed for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>
        <li>When you sign up for a paid service or make a purchase directly through us (rather than through platforms such as iOS or Android), you provide us or the payment processor with information such as your debit or credit card number and other financial information.</li>
        <li>When you participate in focus group surveys or market research, you share with us your opinions about our products and services, your answers to our questions, and your feedback.</li>
        <li>When you contact our support team, we collect the information you provide to us during the call.</li>
        <li>If you provide us with information about other people (for example, if you use a friend's contact information in one of the features), we process such information on your behalf to fulfill your request.</li>
        <li>Of course, we also process your chat conversations with other users and the content you post to make the services work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Information we receive from others</b><p>
    <p>In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we also receive information about you from others:</p>
    <p>Users Other users may share information about you when you use our services, such as when you communicate with us or make a complaint about you.</p>
    <p>Social Media You may choose to share information with us through your social media account, for example if you choose to register and sign into your Veetok account through your social media or other account (such as Facebook, Google or Apple) or upload information, such as photos, from one of your social media accounts (such as Instagram or Spotify) to our services.</p>
    <p>Our partners We may receive information about you from our partners, such as when we publish Veetok ads on our partner services (in this case, they may share information about the success of the advertising campaign). Where permitted by law, we may also receive information from third parties about suspected or verified dishonest users to ensure the safety of our users.
    <p>Information collected when you use our services
    <p>When you use our services, we collect technical information about which features you used, how you used them, and which devices you used to access our services. Learn more about this below:
    <p>Usage data When you interact with the services, we record data about how you use them: how you use them (the date and time you log in, the features you use, the actions you take, the information shown to you, the addresses of pages you clicked on, the ads you click on) and how you communicate with other users (for example, the users you contact and interact with, the time and date of contact, the number of messages you receive and send).
    <p>Device Information We collect information about the devices you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, application settings and characteristics, application crashes, advertising IDs (randomly generated numbers that you can reset in your device settings), IDs associated with cookies or other technologies that can uniquely identify a device or browser.
    <p>Other Information Provided with Your Consent With your permission, we may determine your exact location (latitude and longitude). Location data may be collected in the background, even when you are not using the Services, if you have given us permission to collect this information. If you do not give us permission to collect your exact location information, we will not collect this information. With your consent, we may also collect your photos and videos (for example, after you post photos, videos or live streaming on one of our services).

    <h2>3. Cookies and similar data collection technologies</h2>
    <p>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and your devices. You can read our Cookie Policy to learn more about why we use them and how you can control their use.
    <p>Some browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) have a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") feature that tells a site that the user does not want their online activity tracked. If a site that responds to the DNT signal receives a DNT signal, your browser can block it from collecting certain information about the browser user. Not all browsers support the DNT option, and DNT signals have not yet been unified. For this reason, many companies, including Veetok, do not currently respond to DNT signals.


    4. How we use information

    <p>Providing our service to you: the reason we process your information for purposes A, B and C above is to comply with the terms of the agreement we have with you.

In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by changing your preferences or deleting your content (for example, if you have added information to your profile that may be deemed "sensitive" or "confidential"). In all cases, you can always withdraw your consent by contacting us at the address listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>5. How we share information</h2>
    <p>Because our goal is to help you get to know each other, the main information we share is with other users.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sharing information with other users</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including a public profile). Be careful and make sure you are comfortable posting such content.</p>
    <p>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile, for certain content or information about you, it will be displayed according to your settings.
    <p>If someone files a complaint against, we may inform that person of the action taken in connection with their complaint.
        <ul>
            <li>Providing information to our service providers and partners</li>
        </ul>
    <p>We use third parties to operate and improve our services. These third parties help us with various tasks, including hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer service, marketing, advertising, payment processing, and security operations. We may also provide information to partners who distribute and help us promote our services. For example, we may provide limited information about you to advertising partners in a hashed, human-readable format.</p>
    <p>We conduct a rigorous background check before engaging a service provider or working with an affiliate. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing Profiles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may share other users' profiles and they may share yours outside of our services.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Corporate Transactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may share your information if we are involved, in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, split, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other ownership or management change.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Law Enforcement / Legal Requirement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may disclose your information as necessary to: (i) to comply with court orders, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, to assist in a government/law enforcement investigation, or to comply with other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (in each case according to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of the user.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enforcement of Legal Rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would decrease our liability in an actual or perceived claim; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and the legal rights of our users, business partners or other stakeholders; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent or take other actions regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or other violations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your consent or at your request</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In that case, we will explain why we want to share the information.</p>
    <p>We may use and share non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not itself identify who you are, such as device information, general demographic information, general behavioral data, geodata in an impersonal form) and personal information in hashed, human-readable form in any of the above circumstances. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, human-readable form collected from other sources.</p>

    <h2>6. Cross Border Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>The provision of the information set forth in Section 6 involves the cross-border transfer of data to the United States and other jurisdictions in which different data processing laws may apply. When transferring personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries whose data protection laws are recognized as appropriate by the European Commission or other competent authority, we use standard contractual terms (standard contractual terms are the privacy and data security obligations of companies when transferring personal information) or other appropriate data transfer mechanism. We are currently reviewing how we transfer data to our suppliers and the relevant legal framework in accordance with the recent European Union decision on the transfer of personal data to the United States.

    <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
    <p>We want you to have control over your information, so we remind you that you have the following tools:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tools for accessing/updating data in the service. Account tools and settings through which you can access, correct or delete information provided to us and associated with your account.</li>
        <li>Device permissions. Mobile platforms have permission systems for certain types of data and notifications, such as contacts, photos, geolocation services, push notifications, and advertising identifiers. You can change settings on your device to allow or disallow the collection or processing of relevant information or the display of relevant notifications. However, the prohibition may limit the functionality of some services.</li>
        <li>Deletion. You can stop the collection of all information by an application by uninstalling it using a standard process on your device. Keep in mind that uninstalling the app does NOT delete your account. To delete it, use the corresponding service function.</li>
        <li>Account deletion. You can delete your account using the corresponding service function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information Verification. Laws governing the processing of personal data may give you the right to request information we hold about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called the right of access, the right to data portability and the right to know).</li>
        <li>Updating Information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it, and if you would like to request its correction, deletion, and to challenge or restrict its processing, please contact us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For your protection and the security of all our users, we may ask you to confirm your identity before we can respond to the above requests.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may decline requests, including if we cannot verify your identity, if the request is unlawful, or if it may violate the trade secrets, intellectual property, or privacy of other users. If you wish to obtain information about another user, such as copies of communications received from them or through our service, the other user must contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is shared. We may also ask the user to confirm their identity in order to fulfill the request.</p>
    <p>In addition, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests with an objection to the processing of personal information, especially in cases where such requests would prevent us from providing our services to you. For example, you will not be able to use the service if we do not have your date of birth and we are unable to verify that you are over the age of 18.</p>
    <p>In some countries, including the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about the data protection authority in the EEA here and in the UK here. You can make a complaint to the data protection authority where you live, work or where the alleged breach occurs.</p>
    
    <h2>8. How long we keep your data</h2>
    <p>We only retain your personal information for as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as set out in Section 5) and within the limits of applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you may delete your account and your profile will no longer be visible to other users. Once your account is closed, we will delete your personal information as outlined below:</p>
    <p>1.	To ensure the protection and safety of our users, we retain data for three months after an account is deleted or for one year after it is blocked. During this period, we retain your information in case we need to investigate illegal or malicious activity. The retention of information during this period is based on our legitimate interests as well as the interests of possible third party victims.</p>
    <p>2.	At the end of the retention period, for security purposes, we will delete your information and retain only limited information for the purposes set out below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>a) We retain certain data in accordance with legal data retention obligations: for example, we retain transaction data for 10 years in accordance with tax and accounting requirements, bank card information during the entire period during which the user can dispute the transaction, and "traffic data" / visit logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also retain records of consents provided by users for 5 years to confirm our compliance with applicable law.</li>
    	<li>b) We retain limited information based on our legitimate interests: customer service records and ancillary data and inaccurate download/purchase location for five years to make informed customer service decisions, enforce our rights and defend against claims; past account and subscription information, which we delete three years after your last account closure to ensure proper and accurate financial planning and reporting; profile data for one year in case of potential litigation, for the filing and enforcement of lawsuits, and for protection against them; data necessary to prevent access by users who have been banned from registering a new account, for the period required to ensure the safety and well-being of our users.</li>
    	<li>c) Finally, we retain information based on our legitimate interests when there is an unresolved or possible issue, claim or dispute that requires us to retain information (for example, if we receive a valid subpoena or request to retain data (in which case we will need to retain data in accordance with our legal obligations) or if data is required as part of a legal proceeding).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>9. Protecting children's privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are only available to users 18 years of age or older. We do not allow anyone under the age of 18 to use our platform. If you suspect that a user is under 18 years of age, use the complaint function.</p>

    <h2>10. Job seekers, contractors and supplier representatives</h2>
    <p>We process personal information of job seekers, contractors and supplier representatives as part of our recruitment and human resources operations and as part of the management of services provided by our contractors and suppliers. If you are a Veetok applicant, contractor or supplier representative, certain terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information.</p>
    <p>If you are a job seeker, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job opening you desire, but generally includes what you provide us in your job application, as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information provided to us by recruiters or others. We use this information to organize the hiring process that may lead to an employment contract. We may process contractor and supplier representative identifiers and information related to their employment as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer. We require such information to execute a service agreement and to file, perform or defend against possible legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers who assist us with recruitment and technical data processing. Personal information is only stored for as long as necessary to fulfill those purposes.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We are always looking for new and innovative ways to help you get to know each other and we aim to provide up-to-date information about our approach to data processing, so this Policy may change over time. We will alert you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review them.</p>
